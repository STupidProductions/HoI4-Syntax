## How to add custom syntax?

1. Custom syntax is added in the [user.tmLanguage.json](syntaxes/user.tmLanguage.json) file. To find this on your device, it should be located at `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\stupidproductions.stupid-hoi4-syntax-1.3.3\syntaxes`
2. Once you have that file open, find the appropreiate syntax to add to.
3. To add your syntax; replace the `PLACEHOLDERSOTHISDOESNTMATCHANYTHINGREMOVETHISTOADDYOUROWNTHINGS` string inside of `"match": "\\b()\\b"` with your desired text
    1. To add multiple sets of text use the pipe symbol `|` as a devider
    2. For more advanced syntax you can reference [Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) and [Language Grammars](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars)
4. Restart VSCode or use the `Developer: Reload Window` command

<sup>Warning, updates may overwrite your `user.tmLanguage.json` file, make backups if you are worried about losing it or have a lot of custom syntax!</sup>
